# Cerebral-Stroke-Prediction.
This project predicts cerebral stroke using machine learning on an imbalanced dataset. Sampling techniques like SMOTE, SMOTE-ENN, and SMOTE-NC address class imbalance. Various classifiers are evaluated to find the best model-sampling combo using precision, recall, and F1-score.
